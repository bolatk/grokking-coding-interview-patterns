# Grokking the Coding Interview Patterns Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to problems from the [Grokking the Coding Interview Patterns](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-coding-interview) course.

## Problem List

### Two Pointers
1. Problem 1: Write a function that takes a string, s, as an input and determines whether it is a palindrome.
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)
2. Problem 2: Given an array of integers, move all zeros to the end of the array.
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)
